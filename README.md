# Design Principles

This backend follows a few core principles:

- Backend is the single source of truth.
- Public users have read-only access.
- Only authenticated administrators can modify data.
- Redis is used for sessions and caching.
- MongoDB stores persistent business data.
- Cloudinary stores media assets.
- External APIs are handled by the backend.
